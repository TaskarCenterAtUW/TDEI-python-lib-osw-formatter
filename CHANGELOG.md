# Change log

### 0.2.12
- Updated OSMTaggedNodeParser to apply the OSW node and point filters with normalization before adding loose tagged nodes, ensuring non-compliant features like crossings are no longer emitted.
- Extended serializer tests to cover the new tagged-node behavior, confirming that compliant kerb features are retained while schema-invalid crossings are skipped.
- Updated GeoJSON node export to normalize IDs, retain full OSM identifiers, and skip non-OSW features so schema-invalid crossings are no longer emitted.
- Ensured only synthetic node IDs have their prefix trimmed, fixing the prior bug where numeric IDs lost the leading digit and caused _id/ext:osm_id mismatches.
- Expanded serializer tests to cover OSW-compliant node export, rejection of non-compliant crossings, and prefix handling for generated point IDs. 
- Refined GeoJSON export to filter nodes using tag-only metadata, preventing schema-invalid features from being emitted.
- Normalized ext:osm_id handling to preserve full numeric identifiers while trimming prefixed synthetic values.


### 0.2.11
- Retain numeric `incline` values and new `length` tags during way normalization
- Recognize any `highway=steps` way as stairs, preserving valid `climb` tags
- Add compliance test verifying `incline` survives OSW→OSM→OSW roundtrips

### 0.2.10
- Removed `climb` tag generation from OSM normalizer

### 0.2.9
- Retain existing `incline` and `climb` tags when converting OSW to OSM
- Add `climb` tag when missing and `incline` is provided
- Expanded unit tests for incline/climb handling

### 0.2.8
- Fixed [BUG 2040](https://dev.azure.com/TDEI-UW/TDEI/_workitems/edit/2040)
- Removing the width tag if the width is not float or integer
- Added unit test cases

### 0.2.7
- Fixed [BUG 1654](https://dev.azure.com/TDEI-UW/TDEI/_workitems/edit/1654)
- Added functionality to retain the `ext` tags
## Unit Tests
- Verified all output files are valid GeoJSON FeatureCollections
- Ensured `nodes` files contain only Point geometries
- Validated that all feature `_id` properties are strings
- Asserted no features are missing geometry or coordinates
- Checked that no duplicate `_id` values exist within any generated file

### 0.2.6
- Added unit test cases
- Added unit test cases pipeline
- Added support to upload test cases results on Azure blob

### 0.2.5
- Fixes XML Parsing issue

### 0.2.4
- Fixes MemoryError issue

### 0.2.3
- Fixes dependencies

### 0.2.2
- Fixes the issues with multiple files generated during the conversion.

### 0.2.1
- Adds support for OSM.XML in addition to OSM.PBF file format


### 0.2.0
- Added internal extensions (lines, zones and polygons)
- Made all OSW files optional
- Filter areas out of edges
- Remove osm_id tag from nodes and points
- Add one character prefix to extension id's to avoid collisions
- Create a zone/polygon entity for each exterior and include interiors of each polygon
- Fix bug in circular ways where edges did not meet end-to-end
- Remove internal nodes which serve no purpose
- Add _id to edges
- Update OSM Normalizer: No need to manipulate tactile_paving, remove OSW generated fields
- Update OSW Normalizer: bring normalizer a step close to being based of schema file, update normalizer to OSW 0.2
